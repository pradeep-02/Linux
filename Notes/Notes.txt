=====================
#Memory Mapped files:
=====================
1.This is used to map memory space on disk into process address space.
2.This way what ever will be there in the disk space, can be accessed in the process. 
3.If process writes somethings on the space it will be replicated to the disk space.
4.There are two types of memory mapping:
	Shared: In this modification on the disk file is replicated in all the process address space, who ever mapped that disk 
		space in its address space. This way related & un-related process can communicate.
	Private: In this way, modification are not replicated, when process maps disk space to its address space	
5.APIs: mmap()/msync()/munmap()
